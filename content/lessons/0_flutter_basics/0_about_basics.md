#### This section is for reference, and should be skipped if you're even a bit familiar with Flutter.

Flutter By Example starts off -- pretty much right away -- with Flutter Redux. This makes sense because I'm showing off Flutter by building a full app and documenting it.

But, I couldn't help thinking about people who would see this as their first Flutter resource ever. Using something like Flutter Redux allows someone to basically never use core Flutter tenants like StatefulWidgets, InheritedWidgets, setState() method, and more.

So this is an evolving section that should be used for reference. If you're **brand new** to Flutter, and want to know the core of the technology, you may want to checkout this part of the tutorial.

Otherwise, you can skip this section completely -- the main tutorial begins with the Redux section.
