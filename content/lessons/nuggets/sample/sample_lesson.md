title: "Sample Nugget"
---


Hey there. It's Eric. 

This file isn't really a lesson. I just wanted to show you an easy way that 
you could contribute to Flutter By Example.

I've set up this section, called 'Nuggets.' Here, you'll (one day) find small
 lessons that are just nuggets of information. Short, independent lessons about Flutter. This makes it easier to contribute,
 because you don't need to work on an app that's already being built. (Though
  I would love to see that, too!)
  
I dream of a future when this `Nuggets` section is the `CSS Tricks` of 
Flutter. Quick and easy tips!
   
If you've figured out how to do something awesome in Flutter, share it!
