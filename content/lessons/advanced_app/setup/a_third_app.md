title: "The Advanced App You'll Build"
---

This is what we're working towards:

A trivial app called 'MeSuite'. It's like G-Suite, but for a human that runs their life like a business. It'll be a suite of small apps like habit tracking, calendar, reminders, etc. If you like Computer Science, then you're probably
 at least a bit nuerotic, and you love to track everything. This is the app of your dreams (hopefully).
 
The truth is, this is ambiguous and just allows us to willy-nilly add features that are as easy or hard to add as we 
want. Its pretty trivial to add a todo feature, then a chat feature, then a habit tracker, etc. 
 
In other words, we can focus on Flutter, not nitty gritty details of building a real application.
 
### The Mock Ups

The first feature is a basic Habit Tracker.

Here's a few mockups. This is just so we have a basic direction -- we won't stick to these.

### The Goals

The goal for this app is to learn how to do things the Flutter way. (Aka, the Google way.) You can watch me implement
 the same features in a different way in the Redux / Firebase section, but as I was writing that I realized how much 
 focus is on Redux, which is completely agnostic to Flutter. 
 
I don't think its as easy as just replacing JavaScript with Dart and then writing an application. I think it's a 
different mindset and paradigm. Thus, this app will *not* use Redux.

You'll learn how to leverage all the things that Flutter and Dart give us out of the box to make big beautiful 
applications.
