* In your terminal:

```text
git clone https://github.com/ericwindmill/flutter_by_example_apps.git
cd flutter_by_example_apps/blank_flutter_app
flutter packages get
flutter run
```

**Celebration 1:** You've made a mobile app that can deploy to iOS and Android.

This is what the `blank_flutter_app` looks like:
