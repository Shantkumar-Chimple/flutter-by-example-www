Next, it's time to add auth via Firebase, as well as Firestore database while
you're at it.

Firebase is collection of tools that app developers can use to solve 
'boilerplate' problems. The biggest of which are user authentication and a real-time database.

Firebase is especially appealing in Flutter apps because its another Google product, which means you can bet it'll 
always be compatible, regardless of dependencies and upgrades.

### Integrating Firebase

Adding Firebase functionality to your application is one of the few times that you'll actually have to explore outside your Flutter app's `lib` folder, and add some low level configurations.

There is no way that I could write a better walk-through to setting up Firebase than the people at Google themselves could, so I'm going to send you [to this Codelab about adding Firebase to your app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-firebase/#5)

For the purpose of this tutorial, you should do Step 5 and half of Step 6. Stop when you get the heading 'Add Google Sign-In to Friendlychat'.
