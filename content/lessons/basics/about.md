title: "About Flutter"
---

Flutter is a mobile sdk that, at its core, is fundamentally about empowering
everyone to build beautiful mobile apps. Whether you come from the world of
web development or native mobile development, Flutter makes it easy to create
mobile apps in a familiar, simplified way -- without ever giving up control
to the framework.

Flutter is about the easiest thing to pick up as your first framework
or coming from any other background. In fact, that’s how I’ve found
myself here, writing this post. I had to learn Flutter because of my job, and
I loved it from the moment I started. I effectively became a mobile developer
overnight, because Flutter felt so familiar to my web development background.
(In fact, the Flutter team has openly stated being influenced by ReactJS.)

Flutter isn’t only about being easy, though. It’s also about control, and
that’s where ‘interesting’ turns into ‘exciting’. You can create exceptional
mobile apps with Flutter with a pretty shallow knowledge of the framework. But
you can also create incredible and unique features, if you so choose, because
Flutter exposes everything to the developer.
