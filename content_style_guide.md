# Content Style Guide
## How to style your markdown


## Formatting 

Page Title is included automatically, so no need to add. It is an H1 (#)

## Page Subtitles are H2 (##)

For instances when pages should be logically separated into multiple chunks. Before using, ask yourself: *should this
 be it's own page?*
 

### Step by Step Instructions are H3 (###)

Ideally, each page is divided into steps. I.e. (1. Add a newfile with this code, 2. Refactor this method to do X.)


***

* Everything else i `p` sized. No need to alter.
* Feel free to use (>) blockquotes.
* Use lists liberally.
* Use diagrams, images, and gifs liberally.

## Content

* Clean
* Clear
* Concise

You should challenge yourself to get the point accross in the least number of words possible.
