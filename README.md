Flutter By Example is a complete tutorial for building a mobile application with Google's Flutter SDK, inspired by [Elixir School](https://elixirschool.com/).

Flutter is a new, awesome SDK for building cross-platform mobile apps. It's still in Alpha (as of 2/25/18).

This is simply a resource for learning Flutter from scratch.

## Contributing

I'm hopeful that more Flutter developers will help make this resource rock solid. If you'd like to help, simply fork and make a PR.

This page is written using Gatsby.js. That said, the only thing you _need_ to know how to do is add a file in the proper place and then write content in markdown. If you're unsure about adding new content, please email me at ericwindmill@gmail.com.

There are multiple ways you can contribute:

1. Add a new feature sections to the current tutorial.
   * This would require building on the current content, and adding the current app. Feel free to email me at ericwindmill@gmail.com.
2. Add new stand-alone content.
   * If you want to add write a page that is separate from the main tutorial, have at it.
   * These types of lessons would probably be filed under 'Flutter Basics', though we could always add a new section.
3. Fix errors or improve content.
   * Simply fix something on Github, and make a PR right here.

Contributors will be featured and acknowledged on the Flutter By Example website.
